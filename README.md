# meme-stock

Flows :-
The meme-stock application takes the name of the meme owner, the caption of the meme, and the URL of the meme. Then it stores those memes on the database, when clicked on submit meme buuton.
The page will get automatically refreshed upon clicking on the submit meme button.
Users can view the memes submitted by clicking on the view memes button, which displays all the memes submitted in reverse chronology order. If no memes are submitted, then it shows blank page,
and if more than 100 memes are posted, then it shows only recent 100 memes. Then users can come back to the home page (on which memes are submitted) by clicking on the back button of their browser.
Tech used :-

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript for frontend
Node.js, express.js, Ejs for backend
MongoDB atlas database for storing the memes (name, caption and url)
