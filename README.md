# meme-stock

steps to run locally :

1. clone the project file into Atom (or any text editor, for node.js), and install node.js with npm packages.

 2.(a) for windows users: assuming you've git installed and also have hyper terminal installed (optional), run npm install on your terminal
 2.(b) for mac users: simply run npm install.
This will install all the project dependencies.

3. run node index.js command, this will run the application on your localhost:3000 (as it's listening to this port as well).

4. In your terminal, you'll get output as "server is running on port 3000." That's it, the application is running locally. Note that the database connection is already established, and whatever memes are posted are getting saved.
